# Peel Force Tester

Uses the Polulu DRV8834 motor controller board to control a stepper motor and a HX711 24bit ADC to measure force data.

Uses the [HX711](https://github.com/RobTillaart/HX711/) library by Rob Tillaart and the [Stepper Driver](https://github.com/laurb9/StepperDriver) library by laurb9.

Also includes a Mac Python app to communicate with the Arduino over serial and save force measurements in a CSV.
